GaussianWorld reformulates 3D occupancy prediction as a 4D occupancy forecasting problem conditioned on the current sensor input and propose a **Gaussian World Model** to exploit the scene evolution for perception.

## Overview
To exploit the scene evolution for perception, we reformulate the 3D occupancy prediction as a 4D occupancy forecasting problem conditioned on the current visual input.
We propose a Gaussian World Model (GaussianWorld) to explicitly exploit the scene evolution in the 3D Gaussian space and predict 3D occupancy in a streaming manner.
Our GaussianWorld demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods without introducing additional computation overhead.
